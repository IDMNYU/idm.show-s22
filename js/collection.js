Gameplay has begun to be studied as it relates to students learning about the environment.  My thesis project compares the absorption and retention of facts related to Climate Change by studying participants who read to an article on the subject and comparing them to another group of participants who are exposed to the subject via playing cards, through images and captions.  The facts are exactly the same because I took care to do so as I wrote the article, as suggested by my thesis teacher Prof. Nathanson, and created the playing card game prototype, again, suggested by Prof. Nathanson, thereby creating a more standardized comparison of the two media.  The game prototype, which is currently called Climate Change Rearrange, has undergone several iterations as the cards were tested, and the players' critiques, as well as faculty and fellow student suggestions, were incorporated, particularly in the area play itself.  The game had to be FUN!",

I took inspiration from emojis, GIFs, and avatars to create Snapchat filters where a user's facial expressions control varying augmented elements, ultimately providing insight and clarification for the user's emotional state.

Due to the fact that taichi is a gentler and slower style of boxing than other fighting martial arts, it does not appeal to young people's desire for excitement, confrontation, and skill, and has become unpopular and even somewhat rejected among the young. However, because Taichi is based on the traditional Chinese medical concepts of Qi, Yin, and Yang, and the Five Elements, this sport not only addresses the subhealth problems associated with modern youth, such as stress and an irregular lifestyle but also allows for complete relaxation of the spirit, so it is a great pity that Taichi is so neglected by young people. Thus, I would like to create a virtual reality interactive Taichi game, reviving the ancient Taichi exercise on a modern platform. This project will be developing a method in the virtual world that allows players to experience Taichi, applying how high-tech techniques to a traditional civilization from the past so that players can immerse themselves in Taichi, learn it more easily, and feel the sport's rhythm and connotation more fully.",

			"Long Description of your work (4-6 sentences).": "This project is inspired by anti-vaccination protests that have been seen over the news since the COVID-19 vaccines were first announced. Studies have shown that the main reason people are hesitant to take vaccines is due to their lack of trust in either institutions, government, or medical authorities. People trust their lives to medical professionals in case of any medical emergency, but why is that not the case with the COVID-19 vaccine? The information people consume plays a significant part of what they believe in. This project explores the hesitancy related to vaccines and how the information people receive is enough to induce vaccine doubts towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A prototype was developed with the purpose of trying to make anti-vaxxers think about the issue of vaccination hesitancy and its impact.",

			"Long Description of your work (4-6 sentences).": "My thesis project aims to explore how might we create a better remote onboarding experience for junior employees. The solution is to create an internal mobile application and desktop that support new hires at various points in an onboarding process within an organization. The stakeholders are companies that don’t have the administrative resources to develop an established onboarding program. \n\nThe thesis project derived from the question “how to facilitate employees' creative innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The project uses the Research for Art & Or Design approach to investigate the nature of creative innovation of large technology companies and understand its relationship with workplace culture, environment, artifacts, and other factors. \n\nI leveraged persona-based scenario mapping to illustrate how the product helps the user. Jill Chan, 26 years old, single, based in mountain view, California, will serve as my primary user. She is organized, empathetic, curious, hardworking, passionate, and punctual. She has a Bachelor's degree in Human-Centered Design & Engineering and recently received an offer from a Fortune 500 software company as a product designer. She's excited to begin her first full-time job in a couple of months but nervous because she doesn't know what to expect, especially in a remote work environment amidst the pandemic.\n\nThe feature sets were designed to include 30% core features, 20% quality of life, and 50% future updates. While the mobile application and desktop are both designed for a better onboarding process, they serve different roles for the user. The mobile application greets the user, sends updates for immediate actions, and keeps track of the user's progress. At the same time, the website is a place to set definitive goals and find more detailed content. The features designed as the quality of life are playful elements such as a reward system to encourage more active use of the product. The following updates will include a suggestion board to request new extensions and role-based classes.",

So how can we make riding the subway easier for everyone without tearing everything down? Navigating the Maze is a project that explores the commuting experience and addresses the wayfinding problems in busy New York City subway stations through analyses and observations of information systems, media surfaces, and commuter behavior. The study is based on two stations – 14th St-Union Sq and Jay St-MetroTech, as they serve as major transit hubs in lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. Research methods such as observations, behavioral mapping, and interviews were used to discover the experience navigating through these stations.\nThis project illustrates the ways in which both stations could benefit from having a more contextualized information system and better placements of informational infrastructures. Passengers would be able to make more informed wayfinding decisions and be less likely to be confused, frustrated, or overwhelmed throughout their journey.",

Police violence has impacted Black and POC communities for centuries, and often feels like an evil that can never be escaped. With my thesis work, I aim to create entryways into the conversation of police abolition, and encourage people to actively imagine what a future without police might be like. By creating a collage with augmented reality components that is inspired by conversations about abolition with community members, I aim to immerse my audience in an abolitionist future, and inspire critical conversations about what police abolition could mean for society.",

In Petco and other pet supply stores, I see a lot of dog products but very few cat supplies. Furthermore, cat garments for Sphynx, Devon Rex, and Cornish Rex cats come in restricted patterns, and fitting flaws are more common in the western market. So I began thinking of developing a cat lifestyle brand, starting with cat breed-specific clothes. So I began to consider creating a cat lifestyle brand, starting with clothing for specific cat breeds. I have a background in fashion design, so it's easier for me to begin with something I'm acquainted with. According to my research, Sphynx, Devon Rex, and Cornish Rex cats only have one layer of fur or no fur at all; hence they must wear clothing when the temperature drops below 68 degrees Fahrenheit. This brand aims to create compelling designs from the perspective of cats while maintaining human aesthetics.",

Consistently practicing mindfulness-based meditation and yoga allows me to connect my mind with my body and become more self-aware. I’m also cautiously curious about the psilocybin mushrooms’ potential to heal depression on a deeper level. \n\nI believe that everything we want and need is either already inside us or can be achieved by practice; yoga and meditation are my ways to walk the life path, and the psilocybin mushroom is a very promising tool to illuminate the right pathway we walk towards. \n\nHealing is a life-long journey and Art making is a healing journey within itself. If you’re suffering from pain, I encourage you to look inward. I want you to know that you are not alone and you have the power to heal yourself. \n\nMay you be free from suffering. May you have joy and happiness.",

The essay documents a brief history of Chinese typography in America alongside a series of kinetic typography experiments. Stereotypes, even seemingly small and harmless ones like those built through typographic elements, build an inaccurate view of the ethnic group they are meant to represent. Although increasingly violent and more prominent in these recent years, racism towards Asian people based on these stereotypic and shallow representations is not new! Typography is just one way that history has shown this. “ABC” tries to show how typographic representation can be bilingual and increasingly diversified, and encourages the viewer to think about the connotations of “ethnic” type.",

This cultural pressure silences us and eventually develops into a generational trauma, which is the reason why according to many scientific studies, Asians are the least among other populations to seek help when it comes to mental health. In addressing this matter, I believe it is necessary to configure a step prior to professional psychotherapy as for some of us, the concept is rather foreign and intimidating. In light of breaking this mental health stigma, Mind Sauna is designed in the form of a portable headgear aiming to provide a momentary safe space for the mind to be vulnerable. This 10-minutes long curated meditative experience consists of an interior illuminated skylight with hues subtly changing sequentially, along with an integrated earpiece playing a compilation of other people’s stories on their mental health journeys that allows users to connect emotionally and realize that they are not alone with their problems. The whole experience is hoped to become a source of encouragement where one can find a sense of belonging in the midst of their beautiful mess and be more open-minded towards the practice of psychotherapy in the future.",

In recent years, the impact of chronic stress on mental disorders has become the subject of many studies.  Emotional pressure has become a high-frequency word used in modern society. It is an unavoidable psychological state that everyone is facing. In particular, the global pandemic has exacerbated people's psychological pressure in the past two years. The outbreak of COVID-19 has seriously affected many aspects of people's daily life. Coronavirus not only attacks our bodies but also affects people's mental health in many ways. Therefore, I desire to make an entertaining interactive experience to help more people like me who are under stress to relieve themselves by combining nature and nostalgia aspects.\n           This world is set on floating islands with a low poly style. Experiencers can choose to land on any island to experience different interactive stages. For each island’s experience content, I include these nostalgia factors that can evoke nostalgic memories in most people globally and the natural environment and let players interact with and have many kinds of experiences.\n          This project is developed in Unreal with Magicleap Glasses using Mixed Reality technology. Users can experience and interact with Neverisland in their familiar physical space instead of a completely virtual environment. By comprehensively blending both physical and digital realities, MR is able to build new levels of engagement and immersiveness.",
